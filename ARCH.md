## L2 Deployment Considerations

**Recommended L2s:**
- **Polygon**: Mature ecosystem, low fees, wide adoption
- **Arbitrum**: High Ethereum compatibility, growing DeFi ecosystem  
- **Base**: Coinbase backing, growing creator economy focus

**Deployment Strategy:**
1. Deploy core contracts on chosen L2
2. Use proxy patterns for upgradeability
3. Implement cross-chain messaging for multi-L2 expansion
4. Consider state channels for high-frequency voting
